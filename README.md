This is a small visualisation project using data from the 
Make, Hack, Void Space Probe.

The Space Probe sends out tweets when the MHV hacker space is opened and closed. This project parses them and uses d3 to create a visualisation of the opening and closing times. Used as exercise for learning d3.

This project uses: 

* [d3 visualisation library](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/) 
* [jtwitter](http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jtwitter)
* [jquery](http://jquery.com/)
